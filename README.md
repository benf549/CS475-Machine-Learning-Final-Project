API Access Information:

<font color="red">The API Access Keys are currently stored in plaintext, before pushing to a public repo, probably want to obfuscate or add this to .gitignore. Then again it might not matter since this is a burner account.</font>

Running the jupyter notebook seems to work for now, but at least in my configuration, I have to manually open the redirect link to log in with the burner spotify account from the terminal. I only have to do this once to stay logged in though for the remainder of the program execution which is nice.
